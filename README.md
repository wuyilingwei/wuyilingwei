## 💡 Views

I'm **happy to welcome anyone who can point out errors, provide suggestions, or participate in any of my projects**, but failure to follow the Wisdom of Asking or using offensive language will result in me banning you for no reason.

I support the Anti 996 movement and have developed the Anti-Labor Exploitation License (ALE) 1.1. I believe that protection against exploitation is more fundamental than absolute software freedom, for true freedom can only exist where exploitation is absent. ALE Compliance & Reporting: admin@wuyilingwei.com

I oppose war - regardless of the side. (Please refrain from discussing political affiliations with me)

I don't want to talk about political, racial, and gender (etc. unrelated code) content on github. - So if you try to talk about these with me, you will get blacklisted.

## 💭 End

故事会结束，但生活不会。

我想不出怎样可以尽善尽美，我只能动手去做。

要去思考，去想，然后行动。

Stories will end oneday, but life doesn't.

I couldn't figure out how to make it perfect, I will only try to do my best.

Contemplation, search for solutions, and proceed with action.
