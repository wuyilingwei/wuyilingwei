## 💡 Views

I support [Anti 996](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/blob/master/LICENSE) license and actively apply it to my projects. It's an open license add-on that only authorizes use of the code by non-exploitative companies. We need a future that doesn't exploit workers. (I've applied a modified version, tailored to my needs, with stricter restrictions, which I refer to as the 'Anti-Labor Exploitation License')

I oppose war - regardless of the side. (Please refrain from discussing political affiliations with me)

## 💭End

故事会结束，但生活不会。

我想不出怎样可以尽善尽美，我只能动手去做。

要去思考，去想，然后行动。

Stories will end oneday, but life doesn't.

I couldn't figure out how to make it perfect, I will only try to do my best.

Contemplation, search for solutions, and proceed with action.
